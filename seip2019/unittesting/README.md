# Welcome to the Unittesting SEiP 2019 Code Base

## What it does

This module is created in order to test the java code using JUnit for practicing/learning purposes.

The java code that is going to be tested can be found [here](https://github.com/ionpetro/SEIP2019/tree/master/seip2019/unittesting/src/main/java)

## Getting started

You can easily test the code using the following command on terminal

```
mvn test
```

## Example:

```
